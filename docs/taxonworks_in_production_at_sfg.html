<p><em>This document will change, please check back frequently until this message is gone.</em> It is essentially a <strong>memorandum of understanding</strong> to manage expectations and ensure everyone is on the same page.</p>

<h1 id="why-this-document">Why this document?</h1>

<p>This document is here to help to communicate the relationship between Species File Group collaborations pertaining to their production-instances of TaxonWorks.  It is provided as a resource so that collaborating scientific parties: 1) the Species File Group (<strong>SFG</strong>), and 2) scientists who use an instance of TaxonWorks the <strong>SFG</strong> maintains (<strong>scientists</strong>), can better collaborate, communicate, and understand each other’s roles. We ask that our collaborating <strong>scientists</strong> read this document before they begin to use a production instance of TaxonWorks maintained by the <strong>SFG</strong>.  Some aspects of this document do not pertain to <strong>scientists</strong> who are staff at the Illinois Natural History Survey.</p>

<p><em>This is a non-binding memorandum of understanding.</em></p>

<h1 id="taxonworks-in-production-at-species-file-group">TaxonWorks in production at Species File Group</h1>
<p>There is no one version of TaxonWorks, rather it is free software intended for use by anyone. Indeed, the <strong>SFG</strong>’s long-term goal is to make TaxonWorks ubiquitous, usable anywhere by anyone. The <strong>SFG</strong> is working to make TaxonWorks community-supported and maintained software, i.e. we strive for a future where the <strong>SFG</strong> is <em>not</em> the primary nexus for TaxonWorks developments.</p>

<p>This document pertains only to the instance(s) the <strong>SFG</strong> maintain(s), presently exclusively at https://sfg.taxonworks.org. It <em>does not relate to</em> any other collaboration, planned or existing (including public pages derived from data within https://sfg.taxonworks.org). <em>When the SFG provides a new service to serve public facing websites then a new, second memorandum for that service will emerge.</em></p>

<h1 id="memorandum-of-understanding">Memorandum of understanding</h1>

<h2 id="this-document">This document</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>This is not a legal document but rather a means of communicating aspects of our scientific collaborations.</em></li>
  <li>The <strong>SFG</strong> seeks to be open, and transparent, and in doing so collaborating <strong>scientists</strong> will best understand our relationship with them.</li>
  <li>The <strong>SFG</strong> is unable to provide any legal guarantees regarding any of our collaborations.  We’re all <strong>scientists</strong> doing science, stuff happens.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="taxonworks-and-the-species-file-group">TaxonWorks and the Species File Group</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>SFG</strong> will develop TaxonWorks as <a href="https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks">completely open-source software</a>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>SFG</strong> will announce as far in advance as possible as to any:
    <ul>
      <li>Stoppages in development</li>
      <li>Planned changes to availability (&gt; 8 hours) of https://sfg.taxonworks.org via an email list (<a href="https://speciesfilegroup.org/events.html">details here</a>).</li>
      <li>Major changes to this document {see note at top}</li>
      <li>Major events that may impact our current development plan and philosophy for TaxonWorks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If the <strong>SFG</strong> ceases to support TaxonWorks as a collaborative-service, then the <strong>SFG</strong> will:
    <ul>
      <li>Notify <strong>scientists</strong> at least 4 months before the service ends, or as soon as possible pending unforeseen events</li>
      <li>Encourage <strong>scientists</strong> to generate a complete dump of their data in “raw” SQL format (task currently available)</li>
      <li>Permanently archive and make accessible via publicly available resources (e.g. GitHub, Zenodo, etc.) all supporting data that is cross-project in SQL and CSV formats</li>
      <li>To the extent possible document how <strong>scientists</strong> can migrate to another service hosting TaxonWorks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scientists-using-taxonworks">Scientists using TaxonWorks</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you use TaxonWorks, then regardless of your role, and how you see yourself, the <strong>SFG</strong> considers you a <strong>scientist</strong>. You are helping to do science.</li>
  <li><strong>Scientists</strong> understand that regardless of the perceived permanency of resources, things may change.</li>
  <li><strong>Scientists</strong> understand that they can help the TaxonWorks community group in many different ways, and that this growth will in turn help others.  A larger community means more resources, which in turn results in greater longevity (in theory).</li>
  <li><strong>Scientists</strong> understand that the <strong>SFG</strong> services regarding TaxonWorks are attempts to help <em>you</em> steward your scientific data, the <strong>SFG</strong> are not stewards of <em>your</em> data.</li>
  <li><strong>Scientists</strong> understand that their use of https://sfg.taxonworks.org is as-is, collaborations therein do not mean that downstream services, for example providing publicly accessible sites that showcase their data, will also be available.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>The TaxonWorks community follows a <a href="https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/blob/development/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>.  <strong>Scientists</strong> using TaxonWorks are part of this community. 
* Don’t abuse our collaborations by doing stupid things that aren’t legal, that wouldn’t be cool. Our collaboration is no-different than any-other between you and any of your other scientific peers, you wouldn’t abuse those collaborations, don’t abuse ours.</p>

<h1 id="questions-and-feedback">Questions and feedback</h1>
<p>Questions, concerns, and suggestions for improvement to this document, and any of the services the <strong>SFG</strong> participates in, can be added to this repository via the Issue tracker.  Private concerns can be addressed to Matt Yoder or Ed DeWalt.</p>

<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>

<h2 id="does-the-sfg-charge-for-use-of-httpssfgtaxonworksorg">Does the SFG charge for use of https://sfg.taxonworks.org?</h2>
<p>No. This is an open collaboration, in turn the <strong>SFG</strong> hopes that our collaborating <strong>scientists</strong> will help <a href="https://docs.taxonworks.org/develop/contributing.html">contribute back to the community</a>.</p>

<h2 id="will-the-sfg-ever-charge-for-use-of-httpssfgtaxonworksorg">Will the SFG ever charge for use of https://sfg.taxonworks.org?</h2>
<p>As an endowed group we hope to do as much as we can to support the global biodiversity informatics community with the resources and people we have. As our collaborators grow we would be naive to not be realistic about the costs of these collaborations.</p>

<p>As of now we are committed to growing our collaborations in the manner described here, until at least January 1st, 2023. On or around January 1st, 2023 we anticipate holding a community-wide review, engaging all parties, as to how things are going.  These reviews may precipitate change, but it’s in the best interests of the SFG and our collaborators to see that these changers are not drastic. We anticipate similar reviews on a multi-year (3-5) cycle.  The primary purpose of these is to keep communication open, not to figure out a way how to charge our collaborators, we really, really, really, don’t want to have to do that if at all possible.</p>

<h2 id="if-the-sfg-charges-for-the-use-of-httpssfgtaxonworksorg-will-i-have-an-option-to-migrate-from-it-to-somewhere-else-offering-taxonworks-as-a-service">If the SFG charges for the use of https://sfg.taxonworks.org will I have an option to migrate from it to somewhere else offering TaxonWorks as a service?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. If we ever get to a point where we are forced to have to charge we will outline steps, far in advance, to take our collaboration and move it.  We can’t promise that there will be free services elsewhere, but we can promise that if we cease to host https://sfg.taxonworks.org then there will be a lot of documentation and discussion as to where to go next, and that the underlying software remain open-source so that others can offer services if they have the means.</p>
